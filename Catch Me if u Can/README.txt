The game is easy and understandble.You only need to be quick.

Press the start button. One of nine fields will be purple. You need to click that field, as fast as you can, to move to the next round.

Every round another(not the same) field will be purple and the first you click will be normal.

First rounds are easy but after every round seconds, that you have to click on that field, will decrease.

The main goal is to reach the highest result, so be quick.
